### What is MESH?
MESH is an e-commerce platform that aims to promote and handle the purchasing of consumer electronics.
Guests can see all the products from the home page.
To buy them, a guest can sign-up and buy an item straight from the home page.

All purchases are securely handled by React Stripe.js, an industry-trusted software

## Unsolved issues
There are areas of this project that can be improved over future iterations.

The app currently does not utilize any Stripe routes in the back-end, so our team will focus on that next.

## Development Timeline
### Planning
Our Team decided on an Minmum-Viable-Product (mvp), that includes the user-stories below. While planning, we also decided on removing some features that might have been too amibtious for version 1 (see unsolved issues)

### Process
One of the first areas we focused on, was making sure the site had options to sign up, in, and out. After this initial goal, we aimed to have a process that simulates purchasing an item through stripe so that we can handle the purchase process in the back-end; saving it under a users "my orders" section

### Problem-Solving Strategy
Our team has found that when there is a problem, we would explain it to the whole team and discuss potential work-arounds, or we collectivley search for online resources that could fix the problem. Any updates or fixes to bugs would be communicated to the team as well.
